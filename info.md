All class-related information (including handouts, electronic readings, and assignments) should be accessed through the CS426 web portal located at:
[http://evl.uic.edu/cs426](http://evl.uic.edu/cs426)

For a quick view of results, please see the gallery of final projects.

# 1::Prerequisites
Prerequisites for CS students: CS251 (Data Structures).

Prerequisites for DES students: Creative Coding or Contemporary Product Form or permission from DES. 

-  In non-pandemic years, the class meets in ERF 2068 Continuum; since the classroom is a research facility, special rules of conduct apply (see first class meeting slides). Attendance tends to be 100%, as this course employs massively in-class exercises, presentations, discussion, and critiques. Class will start right on time, often with a quiz or presentation; being consistently late (e.g., 2 or more times) is subject to the ``fair-play`` penalty described in Section 9. :-)

- On many class meetings, this class will have a restrictive policy regarding laptops and smart phones. Devices need to be off for the duration of class discussion and critiques, unless they are specifically requested by the staff for specific tutorials and exercises. We need you to be present, active and alert for the duration of the entire class.


# 2:: Textbooks
While there is a wealth of gaming books available, few enough resources are dedicated to video game design and implementation for computer science and engineering majors. This does not mean that we will not read in this class; quite the contrary. However, most of the class readings will be online. We will read additional articles as necessary (electronic copies will be provided for these). The book we recommend for this class is:

- Game Design Workshop: A Playcentric Approach to Creating Innovative Games, Third Edition, by Tracy Fullerton.

# 4:: Course Grade, Assignments, and Final Project
The course grade will be decided based on the following factors:

- Final project, including intermediate deliverables (40%)
- Class participation (20%)
- Quizzes and exam, assignments and in-class exercises (40%)


Dr. Marai grades based on the overall class performance, and does not curve grades. Hypothetically speaking, if each student in the class does great, the entire class could get an A grade. Generally speaking, a grade within a standard deviation of the class mean is a pass, anything else is not. We will share the grade histogram for the entire class once an assignment is graded, so that you get a sense of how you are doing with respect to the rest of the class.

- Classes will be divided among short lectures, discussions and debates, in-class exercises, quizzes, design critiques, student presentations, and group meetings.

- Many of the assignments will be done in groups. Please note that in this course, as in real life after graduation, whom you get to work with for several exercises is determined by us/your project manager, not by you. When appropriate, all members of a group will earn the same grade, barring exceptional circumstances. We will closely monitor member contributions to the group work, as well as repeatedly ask for peer-based feedback.

- Your primary grade will come from the course projects. While the class discussion and debates will not define your grade, your performance on them can alter your grade (in particular, not paying enough attention to them can cause you to lose a letter grade or more).

- Sometimes you may think that you have been graded unfairly. Please take this up with the TA who graded your assignment. If there is still a problem, Dr. Marai is the final word in grading and will be happy to hear what you have to say. Also, once the grades have gone out, you will only be given two weeks to lodge a protest. In other courses, students have tried to get points back on all of their assignments in the last week of class, and though we would like to promote fair grading, we would like to dismiss malintentioned hassling. Our first priority is fairness (both to us and to you), so please do complain about grades if you don't agree with them.

- Last, but not least, this edition of 426 emphasizes teamwork and oral communication skills, both essential componens of game design and implementation. This emphasis is reflected in both assignments and the class participation component of the grade. To help define successful oral communication, we provide two grading rubrics, one for student presentations and the other one for class discussion (see Section 9 below).

# 5:: Late Policy

We do not accept late assignments. The assignments will sometimes be timed to coincide with a lecture on a topic, so completing the assignment is crucial class preparation. After the class, the assignment will have much less value. The more deadlines you make, and the more serious the ones you keep, the better your grade. An assignment that is 5 minutes late will receive 0 points.


# 6:: Collaboration
You may not discuss the assignment with anyone outside of the permitted group (by default, nobody else) with the sole exception of the course staff.

- If you have specific requests, please ask the course staff privately under Piazza. If the question or answer are of general interest, please post it to Piazza. 

- The project is, naturally, a group activity. Groups will communicate internally in ways defined by the group leadership. Groups may communicate with one another in clearly permitted ways (as defined by the course project requirements).


# 7:: Academic Honesty
The University has an Academic Code that governs all our transactions. In this course, we interpret this code as: All submitted work must be your own. You may not submit as yours work done by a classmate, by a friend, by someone on the internet etc. Always give proper credit. We expect that you, as students and scholars, will abide by this faithfully and fully. Cheating in this course will result in an F for the course.



# 8:: On Writing
We care about your ideas, and we also care equally deeply about the quality of your writing. We care about spelling, capitalization, punctuation, sentence construction, paragraphs, and so on. Avoid passive speech except where appropriate. Extremely good ideas expressed very poorly will earn a very poor grade. The use of Gen-AI tools is not allowed, and probably wouldn't be of much use in this course anyway.

# 9:: On Oral Communication and Discussion of Readings
We care equally deeply about the quality of your speech -- be it during team communication, results presentations, or deploying the game for testing. We want you to be successful, and to this end this semester we provide grading rubrics for class presentation and class participation (see syllabus).


# 10:: Students With Disabilities
If you have a disability for which you are or may be requesting an accommodation, you are encouraged to contact both your instructor and the UIC Disability Resource Center (MC 321), 1200 West Harrison Street, 1190 SSB Chicago, IL 60607-7163 (312) 413-0886, as early as possible in the term. DRC will verify your disability and determine reasonable accommodations for this course.



# 11:: Recording, Copyrights, and CS Code of Conduct
- Audio/Video Recording
To ensure the free and open discussion of ideas, students may not record classrom lectures, discussion and/or activities without the advance written permission of the instructor, and any such recording properly approved in advance can be used solely for the student's own private use.

- Copyrighted Material
All material provided through this web site is subject to copyright. This applies to class/recitation notes, slides, assignments, solutions, project descriptions, etc. You are allowed (and expected!) to use all the provided material for personal use. However, you are strictly prohibited from sharing the material with others in general and from posting the material on the Web or other file sharing venues in particular.

- We expect all students to adhere to the [CS Code of Conduct](http://www.cs.uic.edu/~grad/CS_Code_of_Conduct.pdf), which is also linked from the [Undergraduate CS program homepage](http://cs.uic.edu/undergraduate/student-resources/).
