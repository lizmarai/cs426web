            <br />
            Inkscapade is a puzzle platformer game for PC in which the player
            can draw on the screen to create platforms of ink, with the goal of
            reaching the end of every level. The player has a limited amount of
            ink, and therefore can only create a certain number of platforms per
            level. You have to manage your ink wisely to smartly clear each
            level.

<a href="../finals/2017-Fall/videos/flanders.mp4">Flanders Fields</a> <br>
Group: Anas Ahmad, Mohammed Hasan, Sidney Smith (CS) <br>
Flanders field is set immediately after the first world war. On November 11, 1918 at 11:00 am, Germany capitulated and agreed to the Armistice of Compiegne. This brought an end to the fighting in Europe. Celebrations broke out across the world. But for the soldiers in the trenches, fighting continued. The sound of both german and allied batteries could be heard well past the 11:00 am ceasefire, and thousands would be killed or wounded. The terrain of the battlefields would remain barren for years, with the only poppies to populate the area.
