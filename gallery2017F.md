            Accompanied by his dog, Kalto, Rumi must go on a quest to find all
            the lost windchimes in order to put them together and defeat the
            sorceress to bring the winds back to his land.

            Group: Anas Ahmad, Mohammed Hasan, Sidney Smith (CS) <br />
            Flanders field is set immediately after the first world war. On
            November 11, 1918 at 11:00 am, Germany capitulated and agreed to the
            Armistice of Compiegne. This brought an end to the fighting in
            Europe. Celebrations broke out across the world. But for the
            soldiers in the trenches, fighting continued. The sound of both
            german and allied batteries could be heard well past the 11:00 am
            ceasefire, and thousands would be killed or wounded. The terrain of
            the battlefields would remain barren for years, with the only
            poppies to populate the area.
