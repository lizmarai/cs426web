# 3D Game Engine and Modeling Software

<a href="https://unity3d.com/unity">Unity3D
</a> is a flexible game engine for the design of cross-platform
(Windows, OSX, Linux, web, mobile) game development. The
Personal Edition is free. This is the engine we use in cs426 (versions 5; 5.2
and above including 2017 should do fine).
<br><br>
For those working with VR: CAVE2 works currently with Unity 5.4.3.
Instructions for plugins and for mapping controllers: <a

 VIVE works directly with Unity, although you do need to map the controls:

 Aside from these mappings, you'd also need to consider  how to set up
 things to reduce motion

<a href="https://brashmonkey.com/">Spriter</a>  is an
art-oriented product which enables the “modular” method of animating
where, instead of each frame being a single complete image, it is
constructed from many small, re-useable images (such as body parts). Each
of these images that are used to construct the full frame can be scaled and
rotated to further increase the “mileage” an artist can get from them.

<a href="http://www.blender.org/download/get-blender/">Blender</a> 
is a free and open-source comprehensive 3D production suite, used for making
real-time interactive content. Like Maya, Blender can also have a high
learning curve.
