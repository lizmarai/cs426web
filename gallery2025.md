            The main idea of the game is trying to do IT work during a blackout,
            where players will have to solve IT hardware and software related
            issues for one work week, gain money to upgrade supplies and try to
            earn as much money as possible by the end of the week. Though
            unfortunately the power is shaky and rolling blackouts occur
            regularly and any software related issues cannot be solved when the
            power goes out. It is be designed to work for the platform: x86_64
            Microsoft Windows 10 and above.

            Yume is a fantastical, yet mysterious, adventure/puzzle game based
            within the realm of all dreams. As the dreams of the entire world
            are put under threat, you play as both the main characters, Sando
            and his brother Pheo, across two different yet connected worlds.
            Explore the world of dreams with Sando as you look for a way to
            restore the dreams of the world, while struggling with Pheo to stop
            the nightmares from escaping!

            Inkscapade is a puzzle platformer game for PC in which the player
            can draw on the screen to create platforms of ink, with the goal of
            reaching the end of every level. The player has a limited amount of
            ink, and therefore can only create a certain number of platforms per
            level. You have to manage your ink wisely to smartly clear each
            level.
