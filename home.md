CS426/DES426 covers tools and techniques for the design and
implementation of 3D interactive video games. The emphasis of this
course is on the game design process, integration of art content into
an existing game engine, programming and software development,
team-work, and on developing a fully-fledged game by the end of the
course.

*The current maximum enrollment is 65 students* (the classroom can currently sit 65 students, although not all seats
have a desk). If you are an undergraduate student trying to register and don't see an open
seat, keep an eye on the registration---the CS staff will keep shifting seats from the
DES and CS graduate sections towards the CS undergraduate section starting in December. 


# Course Description
Computer science and design students work in small teams to quickly prototype a series of 3D games throughout the term. For example final projects from previous years, see the Gallery link.

This class uses exclusively Piazza for online communications.

# Course Aims
We have three aims for 426-ers. First, learn enough about video gaming and teamwork to create a starter portfolio for yourselves and to successfully implement 3D video games after you graduate. Second, become a person to whom others turn for advice on game design and development. Third, learn to think clearly about software project issues, spot problems early, articulate your conclusions, communicate with others, and adapt to changes.



# Objectives
When you finish the course, you should be able to:

Collaborate with a team to design and implement a moderately large video game by
- designing the overall project,
- designing the pieces,
- implementing and integrating the pieces,
- demonstrating the result

and

Clearly communicate your ideas to various audiences.
