            Group: Farah Kamleh, Julian Mackenzie, Sebastian Ho
            <br />
            A two-player capture, chase and rescue game for the CAVE2 in which
            both players share all 88 screens but do not see the same image.
            This is achieved by taking advantage of the stereoscopic shader and
            giving Player #1, Death, a 2D-R configuration and Player #2, Life, a
            2D-L configuration.

            of humans to steal their personality and hopefully become human
            yourself, or fail to collect enough personality by midnight and
            remain a mask forever!
